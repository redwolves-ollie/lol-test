    "dialogueLevel0Line1": "Greetings, space explorers! Join me on a cosmic adventure as we explore the mysteries of motion in the universe. I'll be your guide, Newti.",
    "dialogueLevel1Line1": "Let's start with a fundamental concept - \"Motion is the change in an object's position.\" Picture this space as our playground, filled with structures that reveal the mysteries of motion.",
    "dialogueLevel1Line2": "Your goal is to topple all the wooden structures in our cosmic playground to understand motion's essence.",
    "dialogueLevel1Line3": "Prepare to launch projectiles and witness the mesmerizing dance of the elements. Take aim with care and let the principles of motion be your guide.",
    "dialogueLevel1Line4": "As we dismantle structures, we uncover the mysteries of cosmic motion.",
    "dialogueLevel1Line5": "Great job! You successfully moved the asteroid and destroyed all the structures. Congratulations!",
    "dialogueLevel2Line1": "Greetings, young astronomers, to our exciting cosmic journey! Now in this level full of challenges, we will reveal the mysterious link between distance and cosmic force. Get ready for an adventure where every throw counts!",
    "dialogueLevel2Line2": "In the cosmos, we discovered that \"more distance needs more force and less distance needs less force.\" What does that mean? Let's explore it by launching our cosmic rocks at these wooden structures at different distances!",
    "dialogueLevel2Line3": "Imagine each structure as a cosmic constellation. Strong throw for far, gentle touch for near.",
    "dialogueLevel2Line4": "Adjust your cosmic force and see how it affects your throws. Tear down each wooden structure to unlock the hidden cosmic knowledge between distance and strength, brave explorers.",
    "dialogueLevel2Line5": "May the cosmic force guide you in this stellar challenge. Go ahead, destroy and discover in our game universe!",
    "dialogueLevel2Line6": "Congratulations! You have successfully destroyed all the structures!",
    "dialogueLevel3Line1": "Attention, cosmic explorers! Let's explore why the giant stone requires more force to launch on our cosmic journey.",
    "dialogueLevel3Line2": "Imagine that each stone is like a star in the universe, but with its own cosmic mass. The larger stone has more mass than the smaller one, which means it requires more force to move and start its journey through space.",
    "dialogueLevel3Line3": "When launching a heavier spaceship or throwing a larger stone, more force is needed due to the greater mass involved.",
    "dialogueLevel3Line4": "When you throw the big rock, apply more force to account for its mass. Discover the secrets of physics!",
    "dialogueLevel3Line5": "Let's continue our cosmic journey, explorers, and may the cosmic force guide us.",
    "dialogueLevel3Line6": "Congratulations! You have successfully destroyed all the structures!",
    "dialogueLevel4Line1": "Today, we're going to explore the concept of predicting the future based on past movements.",
    "dialogueLevel4Line2": "Do you notice a pattern in my previous launches? Can you identify anything interesting about how I moved?",
    "dialogueLevel4Line3": "Let's collect all the candies as quickly as possible!",
    "dialogueLevel4Line4": "Let's launch the rocks now. Remember to observe carefully and use the pattern we discovered.",
    "dialogueLevel4Line5": "Great job! By recognizing patterns in movements, you could anticipate where rocks would land on the next launch. It's like understanding the universe's secret language.",
    "dialogueLevel4Line6": "Great explorers, understanding patterns helps us predict the future. Let's keep exploring and uncover cosmic mysteries!",
    "dialogueLevel5Line1": "Greetings, cosmic explorers! Let's venture into the Candy Kingdom and discover why the force direction is crucial in our cosmic game.",
    "dialogueLevel5Line2": "Imagine collecting cosmic stars by applying force in the right direction to gather these delicious treasures, just like picking candies.",
    "dialogueLevel5Line3": "When we launch a projectile, whether it's a cosmic rock, the direction we apply force determines its trajectory and the candy it collects.",
    "dialogueLevel5Line4": "If we throw in the wrong direction, some candies may be left behind. But don't worry - with a little practice, we will learn to adjust our direction and collect each candy in the Candy Kingdom.",
    "dialogueLevel5Line5": "Dear explorers, always consider the direction of force when you throw. May every candy collected be a step in our cosmic flavor journey!",
    "dialogueLevel5Line6": "Great job, explorers! Let's keep exploring and collecting cosmic treats. Keep up the good work, brave adventurers!",
    "dialogueLevel6Line1": "Welcome young astronomers, to a universe filled with surprises and twists! Let's explore the concept that a force is simply a push or pull on an object.",
    "dialogueLevel6Line2": "Stones are cosmic dancers, candies are stars. How to make them spin and collide gracefully?",
    "dialogueLevel6Line3": "Our cosmic strategy involves applying a force when throwing the stone, like a gentle breath, causing it to spin toward it candy.",
    "dialogueLevel6Line4": "Magnificent! They have applied a force when throwing the stone, a cosmic push that triggered a beautiful dance between the stones.",
    "dialogueLevel6Line5": "Great job, explorers! Let's keep exploring!",
    "dialogueLevel7Line1": "Greetings, cosmic explorers! In this level, we'll explore patterns in space.",
    "dialogueLevel7Line2": "Take a good look at this basketball court. Do you notice anything special about how the rim moves?",
    "dialogueLevel7Line3": "Today we will learn how we can use regular patterns that objects follow as they move to achieve our cosmic goals.",
    "dialogueLevel7Line4": "Let's have fun scoring cosmic goals by putting the ball into the hoop. Pay attention to the patterns of hoop movement to succeed.",
    "dialogueLevel7Line5": "Well done, explorers. Understanding patterns leads to amazing achievements. Let's keep exploring and uncovering mysteries together.",
    "dialogueLevel8Line1": "Greetings, explorers! In this level, we will predict a pattern with vertical movement.",
    "dialogueLevel8Line2": "Let's have fun shooting the ball into the hoop.",
    "dialogueLevel8Line3": "Well done, explorers! Analyzing patterns from multiple perspectives leads to amazing achievements. Let's keep discovering cosmic mysteries together.",
    "dialogueLevel9Line1": "Greetings, fellow space adventurers! Today, we will explore the fascinating concept of observing and measuring patterns of motion. Are you ready to embark on this cosmic journey of discovery?",
    "dialogueLevel9Line2": "Can you see anything interesting about the way the hoop moves on this basketball court?",
    "dialogueLevel9Line3": "Today we will learn how to measure patterns of motion. Like cosmic scientists!",
    "dialogueLevel9Line4": "Let's score goals while measuring the patterns in hoop movement.",
    "dialogueLevel9Line5": "Well done! You have demonstrated that patterns of motion can be observed and measured. Let's continue our cosmic journey and discover more mysteries!",
    "dialogueLevel10Line1": "Greetings, brave space explorers! In this challenging level, the hoop moves faster! Get ready for an exciting adventure where timing and precision are key.",
    "dialogueLevel10Line2": "In this final level, you must use your skills to throw the ball and score in the hoop. Be cautious as the difficulty has increased.",
    "dialogueLevel10Line3": "Well done, brave explorers! You have successfully conquered the moving target with great skill. See you again next time!",
