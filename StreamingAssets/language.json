    "dialogueLevel0Line1": "Greetings, cosmic pioneers! Welcome to Patterns of Motion with me, where we embark on an adventure to explore the mysteries of motion in the cosmos. I will be your guide, Newti",
    "dialogueLevel1Line1": "Our journey begins with a key concept: \"Motion is the change in position of an object.\" Imagine this space as our playground, filled with structures waiting to reveal the secrets of motion.",
    "dialogueLevel1Line2": "Your mission is to understand the essence of motion by bringing down all the wooden structures in our cosmic playground.",
    "dialogueLevel1Line3": "Get ready to launch projectiles and witness the magnificent dance elements in motion. Aim carefully and let the principles of motion guide your journey.",
    "dialogueLevel1Line4": "Remember, as we destroy structures, we unravel the cosmic secrets of motion.",
    "dialogueLevel1Line5": "Congratulations! You have destroyed all the structures by moving the asteroid!",
    "dialogueLevel2Line1": "Greetings, young astronomers, to our exciting cosmic journey! Now in this level full of challenges, we will reveal the mysterious link between distance and cosmic force. Get ready for an adventure where every throw counts!",
    "dialogueLevel2Line2": "In the cosmos, we discovered that \"more distance needs more force and less distance needs less force.\" What does that mean? Let's explore it by launching our cosmic rocks at these wooden structures at different distances!",
    "dialogueLevel2Line3": "Imagine that each structure is a cosmic constellation. To reach those that are far away, we need a stronger throw. But for nearby ones, a gentle touch will do",
    "dialogueLevel2Line4": "So, brave explorers, adjust your cosmic force and see how it affects your throws. Tear down each wooden structure and unlock the cosmic knowledge hidden in the relationship between distance and strength.",
    "dialogueLevel2Line5": "May the cosmic force guide you in this stellar challenge. Go ahead, destroy and discover in our game universe!",
    "dialogueLevel2Line6": "Congratulations! You have destroyed all the structures!",
    "dialogueLevel3Line1": "Attention, intrepid cosmic explorers! Now let's explore why the giant stone requires more force to be launched on our exciting cosmic journey.",
    "dialogueLevel3Line2": "Imagine that each stone is like a star in the universe, but with its own cosmic mass! The large stone has more mass than the small one, which means it needs more force to change its position and begin its journey through space.",
    "dialogueLevel3Line3": "When we throw the big stone, we must apply more force because its mass is greater. It's like launching a bigger spaceship; it takes more momentum to get it off the ground and move through the cosmos.",
    "dialogueLevel3Line4": "So, at this level, when you select the big rock, remember to apply more force in your throw. See how mass influences motion and unlock the cosmic secrets of physics!",
    "dialogueLevel3Line5": "Let us continue our cosmic journey, explorers, and may the cosmic force guide you.",
    "dialogueLevel3Line6": "Congratulations! You have destroyed all the structures!",
    "dialogueLevel4Line1": "Today, on our thrilling journey, we're going to explore a truly amazing concept. Are you ready to discover how we can predict the future based on past movements?",
    "dialogueLevel4Line2": "Do you see how I moved in these previous launches? It seems like there's a pattern, right? Can anyone notice something interesting about how I moved?",
    "dialogueLevel4Line3": "Exactly! Now, let's apply this knowledge to the next launch. Where do you think I'll land on my next cosmic journey?",
    "dialogueLevel4Line4": "Here we go. Ready to launch rocks? Remember, observe carefully and use the pattern we discovered. Let's launch!",
    "dialogueLevel4Line5": "Amazing! You did great. By understanding the pattern in my past movements, you could anticipate where rocks would land on the next launch. It's like learning the secret language of the universe.",
    "dialogueLevel4Line6": "Bravo, explorers! You've shown that by understanding patterns, we can make incredible predictions about the future. Let's continue exploring together and unveiling cosmic mysteries!",
    "dialogueLevel5Line1": "Greetings, sweet explorers of the cosmos! Now dive with me into the Candy Kingdom, where we will discover why the direction of the force is crucial in our cosmic game.",
    "dialogueLevel5Line2": "Imagine that each candy is a small cosmic star that we want to collect. But you know what? We need to apply force in the right direction to gather all these delicious cosmic treasures!\n",
    "dialogueLevel5Line3": "When launching our projectile, whether it's a cosmic rock or a bubbling explosion of energy, the direction of the force we apply determines where it will go and how it will collect those delicious candies",
    "dialogueLevel5Line4": "If we throw in the wrong direction, some candies might be left behind. But don't worry! With a little practice, we will learn to adjust the direction and collect each candy in the Candy Kingdom.",
    "dialogueLevel5Line5": "So, sweet explorers, always remember to consider the direction of the force in your throws. May each candy collected be another step on our cosmic journey of flavors!",
    "dialogueLevel5Line6": "Bravo, explorers! Let's continue exploring and collecting cosmic sweets, intrepid explorers.",
    "dialogueLevel6Line1": "Welcome, little astronomers, to a cosmic level full of twists and sweet surprises! We will now explore the intriguing concept that \"a force is a push or pull on an object.\"",
    "dialogueLevel6Line2": "Imagine that each stone is a cosmic dancer eager to spin and each candy is a star that wants to shine even brighter. But how do we make the stone spin and, at the same time, gracefully collide with another candy?",
    "dialogueLevel6Line3": "That's where our cunning cosmic strategy comes in! First, apply a force when throwing the stone, like a gentle cosmic breath. Watch as the stone spins and heads toward its cosmic companion.",
    "dialogueLevel6Line4": "Magnificent! They have applied a force when throwing the stone, a cosmic push that triggered a beautiful dance between the stones. But, the cosmic choreography is not yet complete.",
    "dialogueLevel6Line5": "Now, watch carefully. The moving stone also exerts a force on the candy, attracting it with its cosmic energy. And voil√†, the cosmic dance reaches its climax with a celestial crash!",
    "dialogueLevel6Line6": "Bravo, explorers! Let's continue exploring!",
    "dialogueLevel7Line1": "Greetings, fearless cosmic explorers! In this thrilling level, we're going to explore how the motion of objects can follow regular patterns. Are you ready to dive into the fascinating world of patterns in space?",
    "dialogueLevel7Line2": "Take a good look at this cosmic field. Do you notice anything special about how the objects are moving?",
    "dialogueLevel7Line3": "Exactly! In some situations, like this one, objects follow regular patterns as they move. Today, we'll learn how we can harness those patterns to achieve our cosmic goals.",
    "dialogueLevel7Line4": "Let's have some fun scoring cosmic goals. You need to put the ball into the hoop. But here's the trick: the patterns in the movement of objects will tell you how to do it!",
    "dialogueLevel7Line5": "Bravo, fearless explorers. You've shown that by understanding patterns, you can achieve incredible goals. Let's continue exploring and uncovering cosmic mysteries together.",
    "dialogueLevel8Line1": "Greetings, intrepid cosmic explorers! In this exciting level, we are going to practice the theory from the previous level, but in this level we are going to predict a regular pattern that has vertical movement.",
    "dialogueLevel8Line2": "Let's have fun scoring cosmic goals. You need to put the ball in the hoop.",
    "dialogueLevel8Line3": "Bravo, intrepid explorers. You have shown that by understanding patterns from different directions you can achieve incredible goals. Let's continue exploring and discovering cosmic mysteries together.",
    "dialogueLevel9Line1": "Greetings, young cosmic adventurers! Today, our mission involves understanding a fantastic concept: the ability to observe and measure patterns of motion. Are you ready to embark on this cosmic journey of discovery?",
    "dialogueLevel9Line2": "Take a look at this cosmic playground. Can you spot anything interesting about how objects are moving?",
    "dialogueLevel9Line3": "Fantastic! Today, we're going to learn that patterns of motion, the way things move, can be not only seen but also measured. It's like becoming cosmic scientists!",
    "dialogueLevel9Line4": "Let's have a blast scoring cosmic goals. Your task is not only to put the ball into the goal or bucket but also to measure the patterns in its motion.",
    "dialogueLevel9Line5": "Incredible! By understanding and measuring the patterns in the ball's motion, you've not only scored goals but also become true cosmic scientists. Each launch is a chance to explore the secrets of motion!",
    "dialogueLevel9Line6": "Bravo, cosmic scholars! You've demonstrated that patterns of motion can be both observed and measured. Let's continue our cosmic journey of discovery and see what mysteries await us!",
    "dialogueLevel10Line1": "Greetings, brave explorers of the cosmos! In this challenging level, the cosmic goal not only waits, but also dares to move! Get ready for an exciting adventure where precision and timing become your best allies.",
    "dialogueLevel10Line2": "See that goal sliding through space? Your mission is to launch the cosmic ball skillfully and bring it to this moving target! But beware, intrepid adventurers, the difficulty has risen on our cosmic journey!",
    "dialogueLevel10Line3": "Bravo, intrepid explorers! They have conquered the moving goal with mastery. Until next time!",
