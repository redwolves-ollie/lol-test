    "dialogueLevel0Line1": "Hello Explorers! Let's discover the secrets of motion in the universe together. I'm Newti, and I'll be your guide.",
    "dialogueLevel1Line1": "Motion means when something moves from one place to another. Imagine this area as our playground, where we can learn about motion by exploring different structures.",
    "dialogueLevel1Line2": "Your goal is to understand motion by toppling all the wooden structures in our space playground.",
    "dialogueLevel1Line3": "Congratulations on a job well done! You have successfully fired multiple projectiles and toppled all the structures.",
    "dialogueLevel2Line1": "In this level, we will explore the connection between cosmic force and distance.",
    "dialogueLevel2Line2": "We discovered that objects require more force to travel longer distances and less force to travel shorter distances.",
    "dialogueLevel2Line3": "Adjust your strength and distance and see how it affects your throws against the wooden structures.",
    "dialogueLevel2Line4": "Congratulations! You have successfully destroyed all of the structures!",
    "dialogueLevel3Line1": "Let's explore why launching the giant stone requires more force on our cosmic voyage.",
    "dialogueLevel3Line2": "Stones are like stars in the universe, with varying mass. Larger stones need more force to move and start their journey through space.",
    "dialogueLevel3Line3": "When throwing a heavy rock, apply more force to compensate for its mass. Discover the principles of physics!",
    "dialogueLevel3Line4": "Congratulations! You have successfully destroyed all the structures!",
    "dialogueLevel4Line1": "Let us explore the concept of predicting the future of an object based on past movements.",
    "dialogueLevel4Line2": "Let's collect all the candies in this area!",
    "dialogueLevel4Line3": "Congratulations! By recognizing patterns in movements, you could anticipate where the rock would land on the next launch.",
    "dialogueLevel5Line1": "Let's explore the importance of force direction in our journey through the cosmos.",
    "dialogueLevel5Line2": "When we launch a projectile, the direction we apply force determines its trajectory and the place where it will land.",
    "dialogueLevel5Line3": "If we throw the candies only in one direction, some may be left behind. With a bit of practice, we can adjust our aim and collect all the candies.",
    "dialogueLevel5Line4": "Excellent work! Let's continue to explore and collect cosmic treats. Keep up the great effort!",
    "dialogueLevel6Line1": "Let's examine the idea that forces are simply pushes or pulls on objects.",
    "dialogueLevel6Line2": "Our strategy involves applying force to the stone to make it fall towards the candy.",
    "dialogueLevel6Line3": "Magnificent! The force of throwing the stone caused a beautiful collision that helped us reach our objective.",
    "dialogueLevel7Line1": "Greetings! In this particular level, we'll explore patterns of movement in space.",
    "dialogueLevel7Line2": "Let's take into account that while shooting a basketball, the target is in a constant motion.",
    "dialogueLevel7Line3": "Great job, explorers! The ability to identify patterns can lead to incredible accomplishments.",
    "dialogueLevel8Line1": "Hello, adventurers! In this level, we need to anticipate a vertical movement pattern.",
    "dialogueLevel8Line2": "Great job! Examining patterns from various perspectives can result in remarkable accomplishments.",
    "dialogueLevel9Line1": "Hello there! Today, we will delve into the topic of observing and measuring patterns of motion.",
    "dialogueLevel9Line2": "For a better shot, make sure to watch the full extent of the hoop animation.",
    "dialogueLevel9Line3": "Congratulations on demonstrating the observance and measurement of patterns of motion!",
    "dialogueLevel10Line1": "Greetings! Prepare for an exciting adventure where timing and precision are key. Be ready - the hoop moves faster in this challenging level.",
    "dialogueLevel10Line2": "Excellent! You have successfully conquered the moving target with great skill.",
    "dialogueLevel10Line3": "Our space mission has come to an end, but we are eagerly looking forward to more thrilling adventures in the future. See you soon!",
